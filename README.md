# Class 10 – First HTML Project 🌱

This project was created by **Aditya Bhardwaj** when I was in **Class 10** as part of a **school Computer Assignment**.

This was my **first ever website project**, built while learning the basics of **HTML and CSS**.  
The project focuses on the topic **“The Himalayas”** and contains multiple interconnected pages explaining different Himalayan ranges, along with a credits page.

## Important Note

- This repository contains the **raw and original files** of the project.
- The structure, styling approach, and code style reflect my **early learning stage**.
- The project has **not been modernized or redesigned**.
- Only minor fixes were made later to ensure files load correctly (paths, basic validation), while keeping the **original intent and layout unchanged**.

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  

(No frameworks, no libraries — just basics.)

## Purpose of This Project

- Academic submission for Class 10  
- Learning fundamentals of web development  
- Understanding page linking, images, tables, and basic styling  

## Why This Repository Exists

This project is kept as a **personal milestone** to document my starting point in programming and web development.  
It represents where my journey began.
